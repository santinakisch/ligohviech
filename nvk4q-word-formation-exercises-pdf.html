On today's episode of Holy Crap We're All Going to Die , I want to take a walk through the logistics of the upcoming Battle of Winterfell, breakdown the combined forces of the Army of the Living, and measure what they're up against. I know there have been a few posts about this subject already, and here I want to give a shout-out to my fellow Thrones maesters, especially. The /r/Futurology subreddit frequently features highly upvoted posts on cell-based meat, reflecting the media attention and public interest that has followed the industry. There are many introductory resources to how cell-based meat is produced and what its benefits may be, however there are no comprehensive resources which fully inform those interested in learning more. Below you’ll find the first post in a 6 part series (to be posted monthly) which walks through the science driving the innovat. So.I've gotten a lot of benefit in the last year from Botox, but there are definitely well-founded concerns out there about its effects on the TMJ bone/cartilage architecture, so I did some digging in the literature. This is what I posted as a comment in another post, but I thought it might be of broader interest. Here's what it seems like we know about Botox and TMJ health. Animal Studies Botox causes TMJ bone loss in rabbits in 4 weeks - 40% bone loss in condyle.

Welcome to Monday Methods, a bi-weekly feature where we discuss, explain, and explore historical methods, historiography, and theoretical frameworks concerning history. Today's topic is Edward Said's book Orientalism and how it exemplifies what cultural scholars, historians and so forth frequently describe as "othering" – the mechanism of defining who "we" are by defining who "we" not are – who is "the other". Edward Said, a professor of literature at Columbia University and today counted. The timeline itself is pretty long and more detailed, so I'll link the Tumblr version here ( I wrote this post quite a while ago, but with a recent thread discussing Tom Riddle's upbringing (https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/8jf5kw/i_reread_hbp_and_i_think_that_voldemort_bad/) by /u/Beerus_90, I thought I would share it an edited-for-Reddit version below.

For a Guardsman, there were many things wrong with life on a mass conveyance ship. Strange noises echoed through the hull at all hours. The only open space available was in a cargo hold often filled with regimental equipment. The menials and servitors crowded around stations and tasks, turning every part of the vessel outside of a single ill-defined cargo zone into foreign territory. None of the layout was explained to them, even by the naval ratings. And no one really knew when they would. Ray Dalio is a particular man. He founded Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, which manages over 0 billion. As of right now, Ray is worth more than  billion, and also the author of Principles, the NYTimes best seller. But this story isn't about Ray - it's about how Principles became a book in the first place. It's a story about generosity and taking what resources you have to seek a more enriching life. #Principles# Ray gained fame after the 2008 market crash; he had short. Gauging by the number of inquiries and 'requests for evidence' related to topics mentioned in the title of this thread, think it's about the time to 'connect the dots' and explain the entire story in one place.

This was a daunting time, seeing as though this was my first AP class and I had a schedule loaded with other difficult courses. At over 1000 pages across 42 chapters, it was probably one of the thickest and densest, and not to mention heaviest, textbooks I had yet seen. For a course that covers as much content as the entirety of US History in a single year (which according to the sometimes overly-patriotic autho. Hello, everyone. Here are some biomechanics resources you might find helpful. Note that some of the arguments made in these videos are actively debated in the literature so this isn't the end-all-be-all of biomechanics. Hopefully this will help you become a better squatter/bencher/deadlifter. But please don't use these resources, specifically the genetic argument, to make excuses to avoid squatting. To truly determine what your anatomical genetic limits are you need an MRI or X-ray. Hi everyone, I cant say I've ever looked into this treasure hunt before today, but I had a boring lecture and stumbled across this during the day. I used google to do most of my research, but I liked this as an exercise of futility (I live in Europe). Anyway, hope you enjoy my European take on the hunt and good luck everyone!

Right so I wanted to contribute some decent OC and one thing I do know about is football tactics. So let's go! I think United are suffering because of the tactics of LVG. That's not to say he isn't a capable manager, this thread isn't about debating that stuff. Rather, I want to just go over some tactical stuff and see what we can come up with.

This will be a very drawn out post so please bear with me. Empathy is a core human trait, and it allows us to forge and maintain social connections, enjoy each others company, share in each other’s emotions, and “feel connected” to each other. It is such central capacity to the human identity that humanity is often defined by what empathy fosters, and adjectives referring to humanness ( are used to refer to that which is caring, considerate. Aye, the Talking Stone set us a task! A bloody impossible one! Only once the full Codex of the Titans was read aloud to it would it grant us access into the lost diggings.

On the day that hell came to Selys, Sergeant Chayse started the day the way he usually did; with a reprimand. It had become a common occurrence within his daily routine, to be called up on one charge or another, be it negligence in equipment maintenance, deviation from specified orders, or unruly conduct. But most often cited was his attitude; simply put, what little he had did not fit the disposition that the Governor wanted in his Planetary Defence Force Infantrymen. In school he had always.
