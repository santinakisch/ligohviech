My school's Physics department has grown a lot in the recent years. I have a professor that has taught many classes in the department due to how short staffed they were. However he still swaps and teaches different classes in the department. As such, he keeps all of his lecture notes online. They have examples with full solutions and he updates it every year. I found it very useful even in classes he did not teach. As such I hope it is a good supplement for you in any of your courses! This is a LaTeX template to help you prepare a paper for Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Titles include: Lecture Notes. We're already paying a ridiculously high tuition and on top of that we have to pay extra for lecture notes and practice exams? If the professors have the students best interest in mind then they would release these for everyone to understand the content better. On top of that they make us buy the current edition of lab manuals even though the winter quarter and fall quarter lab manuals were exactly the same. Not to mention the mandatory access codes in order to do homework and forcing USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes Behavioral Science and Social Sciences Publisher's Note: Products purchased from party sellers are not guaranteed I don't think they ever developed proper typing skills because they seem to only type with 6 fingers. The prof talks fast and I can see that sometimes they struggle to keep up. I can tell that they are looking at my laptop. So I've started to turn my laptop slightly in their direction and zoom in the screen a bit so they can copy my notes. 
Hi all, I lost my spiral for CLAS 430 and was hoping I could get some notes before the midterm on Wednesday. I'm willing to venmo  to anyone who sends me notes - any help would be really appreciated. Hi! I will be matriculating this August. I would like to study ahead as I have quite a bit of free time. I was wondering whether any current CS students would be willing to share their lecture notes Hello all, I've been looking for Mark Klimek lecture notes/"blue book" but cannot seem to access it anywhere. Does anyone have a copy or source they'd be willing to share with me? please please please and Thank you so much! :\ andrea.looove@gmail.com (mailto:andrea.looove@gmail.com). Salut! Starting comp 1113 soon and was told that I need to purchase lecture notes ( by Goran Ruzic ) from the bookstore. I am a big fan of "reuse and recycle" approach so if anyone can recommend a place where I can buy used version I would appreciate 
Struggling sophomore here. Calculus is hard and I need this book which I heard Taking a commonly enrolled course this summer but looking to get a head start - is there a recommended resource to get past lecture notes from a course. Hello friends , Ok the title is very vague and weirdly phrase i apologise for that friends! Im a J1 thats seeking lecture notes from other schools to be used as additional resources to add on to the ones im currently using which is from my school. Most of the people i realised are selling their notes away on carousell but i have no intention of buying as im from a lower income family(and i strongly believe education should be free , including resources!) so it would be great if you could leave. </p>
