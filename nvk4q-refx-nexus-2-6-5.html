Ight, so basically I'm in a bit of a nutshell here. I've heard many opinions on which plugin makes the best out of making rap beats, and just a week ago I was able to pirate refx nexus 2 and add it to fl studio. Even though I copped it for free, I did further people say that refx nexus 2 isn't a good plugin and that it's limited to other plugins such as omniosphere, komplete, massive, and other such plugins. Thoughts. Hello, I'm a serious hobbyinst producer, sometimes ago I had the opportunity to practice using refx nexus 2 and fell in love with its rich pads and lead synths. Since then I wasn't able to find an equivalent substitute for that particular sounds. I own Komplete Ultimate 11 but in the whole package I wasn't able to find such rich pad sounds. I'm wondering is there a NI synth that is able to produce such sounds? I could only find very elaborate pad sounds, like evolving ones, atmosphere Hi all, amp#x200B; after like 2-3 years I want to go back to music production as a hobbyist. amp#x200B; Do you have any VST or Sample recommendations? When I used to produce I often used Sylenth1, Massive and refx Nexus stuff. I hope this is the right place to ask this! amp#x200B; Thanks. Hi, I search about vst plugin for chord progression I have Serum amp Sylenth1 and both awesome but specially for melody. Any suggestions for plugin for chord progression (except refx nexus) Thanks. Hey guys, I was gonna build this PC but I wanted to see what you guys thought before I got the parts. For music production I'm using FL Studio 20 with various plugins such as Sylenth1, refx Nexus 2, Kontakt (Different sample add-ons), Omnisphere, Dune 2 and Massive. Due to me having a lot of sampler plugins, I added a lot of RAM, 16 gb to be specific. I might get Avid Pro Tools in the future. As far as video editing goes, I'll be using adobe premier pro. I designed refx nexus 2 complete bundle 2018 version. 
Hello people of this sub! I am a producer that has started in the beginning of this month and have been using Sakura and refx nexus the most and playing around with sytrus, morphine, dune and Electra x but I was wondering and up to suggestions on resources to learn more stuff about the synth as well as what are good synths to start off with learning Cheers. Hey Y'all. I've been trying to get REFX Nexus 2 going with jbridger and such, and besides the long loading time, the VST loads fine. But 60-70% of the presets just. don't make any sound? There is a light in the plugin that shows midi input when I hit keys on my controller, and Ableton registers the input as well, but all I get is silence. Has anyone else had this issue, and is there Hi, i've just installed and patched Omnisphere and can't seem to activate it in fl studio 12. I've installed a few other vst's like refx nexus or autotune and it workd fine. I select the location of the vst in the plugin manager, then i do a scan, omnisphere shows up two times, i check it and close the plugin manager but it just resets the whole thing and when i open it back up the path i added is still checked but i have to scan again to see omnisphere. I mean this looks like a pretty Hey all, I'm looking to build a computer mainly for music production, but also a little gaming. For Music Production, I use FL Studio 20. and along with that I use plugins Sylenth1, refx Nexus, Dune 2 and Kontakt 5. I just don't want my CPU to overload and cause my projects to crash. For gaming, I only play a few games. These include The Elder Scrolls Online, Minecraft, Geometry Dash and Wizard101. The main game that I want to work really well and run smoothly is the elder scrolls. 
Hey guys (hope this is the right subreddit), I am considering saving up for this laptop because I want a new one to use for personal use (the only one I have right now is a school laptop which sucks). I'm going to use it to make music (on the program FL Studio) with other plugins (such as sylenth1, refx Nexus, and serum). I'm also probably going to play some video games, probably just Minecraft and Wizard101 (the nostalgia made me do it XD). The laptop is a MSI GL62M 7RD-265. I don't really. What instruments does the 0 refx nexus 2 come with? Does it have flutes, bells, 808s and stuff I know eople forced refx nexus for long, but I found it cant do pitchy synthy noise modern EDM things, and kinda its more paddish, trance sounding. I know there is sylenth1, which is great too. But, yeah, is there anything like similar to sylenth, that has already sounds or libraries, as i like to pick sound, cant design it. Name some.? Thanks in advance. I currently wanna build up the tools that will help me make hip hop, RampB, and pop. Right now what i use is sytrus, addictive keys, and most of the fl signature stock plugins. But im looking to upgrade. native instruments komplete 12? Omnisphere 2? Refx NEXUS? ( starter edition) should i ditch getting omnisphere since i already use sytrus. Hello, I started just on Monday quitting using presets. I find it very lazy written and not a fun way to make music to its full form. I also find using presets to be over saturated in music nowadays. I am planning on quitting using refx nexus and going for a realistic piano plugin to use in my tracks and just add some effects over it to sound different. How many of you are doing the same? Is it getting harder for you or it is a learning experience for you? For me, I find it a learning experienc.

I don't really have much experience with laptops REFX Nexus 2 for mac? a working version please. Hey all, I'm currently considering buying a new Soft Synth Plugin. I'm looking at Spectrasonics Omnisphere 2 amp REFX Nexus 2. Do any of you have experience with both? Are they comparable? Is one better than the other? I know that both synths are not necessarily popular for their sound design, as much as they are for their actual presets. And that's the main reason I'm looking into them. I want some solid presets to layer sounds together. I primarily make Melodic Trap, Future Hey y’all, I posted a request for help on choosing a laptop a while ago, but no one was able to help me. I thought maybe you guys could help me. Here is the form: Total budget and country of purchase: The ballpark of my budget 00 Canadian. Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I don't want a two in one, and battery life and specs are most important to me. How important is weight.
